## As we re-use the puppet certificates for salt, there is a race condition where the client can attempt
## to start prior the salt-master having the clients public cert (via an exported resource).  In this case
## the minion immediately dies.  If this is a prod node, and thus puppet is set to noop by default, then
## the salt minion will never end up starting.  This works around that issue.  There is no scenario where
## the salt minion should be disabled on a node so this is considered safe.
